# Inventory Management CLI with Go

## Introduction

This project implements an inventory management CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Go. The application allows users to manage an inventory by reading from and writing to a .csv file. The user can view the current inventory and add new products to it.

## Features

- Read Inventory: Reads the existing inventory from a .csv file.
- Create Inventory: Creates a new .csv file if it does not already exist.
- Display Inventory: Prints the list of inventory products.
- Add Products: Allows the user to add new products to the inventory.

## Project Goals

The main goals of developing this project were to:

Utilize Go's Writer and Reader interfaces.
Handle file operations on the computer.
Receive and process user input from the terminal.
Use structs to represent inventory items.
Gain hands-on experience with Go, as this is my first contact with the language.
